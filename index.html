  <br>
  <p>This cheatsheet is the 2nd off world project on the Codecademy Front-End engineering course. I have used this opportunity to get a bit creative and show what I have learned up to this point(13%). The "td" was also selected for specific purposes.</p>
  <table>
    <thead>
     <tr>
      <th scope="col" class="head"><h3>Property</h3></th>
      <th scope="col" class="head"><h3>Feature</h3></th>
      <th scope="col"><h3>Description</th></h3>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Display</td>
       <td>Inline</td>
       <td>Displays inline element (like &lt;span&gt;). Takes up the width and height of the element <span>only</span>. Will follow the element even if it goes onto anothe line.</td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
       <td>Position</td>
       <td>Relative</td>
       <td>The element is positioned relative to its normal position, whereas absolute will be positioned to that of its closest ancestor. Left 20px is the same figure but will impact them in different ways although moving the same distance.
      </td>
    <tr>
      <td>Margin</td>
      <td>Collapse</td>
      <td>Adds spacing around the element rather than within. With margin collapse, margin-bottom(30px) for the top element will not combine with the second elements margin top(20px) to create 50px. The overall space will be set at margin-bottom. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Padding</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>Adds space within the element and therefore impacts the width of the elment once added. It is the space between the elements content and the border.</td>
